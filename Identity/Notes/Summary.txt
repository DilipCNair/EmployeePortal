My main expertise is in Developing softwares using C#. Having more than 2 Years of experience in .NET development, I have developed a Web Application in ASP.NET MVC (HRMS) and a Cyber security-based desktop application in WPF (Host-based IDS). Being a Post Graduate in Cyber Security I also have 2 years of experience learning and researching in the field of Cyber security independently (mainly in Reverse Engineering Binaries). I am also proficient in Linux, Computer Networks, and Cryptography concepts. So having sufficient expertise in software development (mainly in .NET) and cyber security I can make a major contribution to these fields. My experience in cyber security makes me a better software engineer.
